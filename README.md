# CPP_project_01
My first C++ Project:
<br>
Autohor- Joy Shib
<br>
<br>
This is a simple countdown timer that counts down from 6 to 0, then says "Go!". The timer is written in C++ and uses the thread library to sleep for one second between each count.
<br>
Usage:
<br>
<br>
To use the timer, simply clone the repository to your computer and then run the main.cpp file. The timer will start counting down immediately.
<br>
Sample output:
<br>
<br>
-------
| Go! |
-------
    6

-------
| Go! |
-------
    5
...
-------
| Go! |
-------
    0
-------
| Go! |
-------
    Go!

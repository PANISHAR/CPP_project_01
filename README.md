Welcome to the Grade Calculator! This simple C++ program, developed by Joy Shib, is designed to help students calculate their grades based on various assessments such as attendance, assignments, class tests, midterms, and final exams. The program provides a detailed grade report, including the total marks, percentage, assigned grade, and a personalized message based on the performance.
